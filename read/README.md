## Summary

This project involves creating a Rock Paper Scissors game that started in the browser console and evolved to include a graphical user interface. The game allows users to play against the computer, with the outcome determined by standard rules of Rock Paper Scissors.

## Key Features:

+ Console-Based Game: Initial implementation focused on the core logic and functionality in the browser console.
+ User Interface: Added a user-friendly UI with buttons and game feedback to enhance user experience.
+ Responsive Design: Ensured that the game is accessible and visually appealing across different devices.

## What is Rock Paper and Scissors?

Rock Paper Scissors is an intransitive hand game typically played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:

+ Rock: A closed fist.
+ Paper: A flat hand.
+ Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V.

## Game Dynamics:

+ Win: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
+ Draw: Both players choose the same shape.
+ Gameplay: The game is zero-sum, meaning one player’s gain is the other player’s loss. A tie results in a replay.
